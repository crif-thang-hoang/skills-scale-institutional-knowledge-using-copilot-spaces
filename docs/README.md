# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation hub. This collection serves as the single entry point for understanding how we plan, execute, and deliver successful projects at OctoAcme.

## Purpose

This documentation collection helps team members:
- Quickly understand OctoAcme's project management approach and processes
- Navigate to specific process guidance for different project phases
- Onboard new team members efficiently with clear, structured information
- Maintain consistency across projects through shared practices
- Foster knowledge sharing and continuous improvement

## Comprehensive Project Management Overview

### Core Principles

OctoAcme's project management approach is built on five foundational principles:

- **Customer-first**: We prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: We deliver small, testable increments to reduce risk and gather feedback early
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead with defined responsibilities
- **Data-informed decisions**: We measure impact and iterate based on evidence, not assumptions
- **Psychological safety**: We encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

### Project Lifecycle

OctoAcme follows a five-phase project lifecycle:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, and create a high-level timeline with a Project One-pager including SMART objectives and success metrics
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, create a prioritized backlog, identify dependencies, and establish a release plan
3. **Execution**: Build, test, review, and iterate on features with continuous tracking and risk management through the Risk Register
4. **Release**: Deploy to production with verification, announcements, and rollback plans ready
5. **Close & Retrospective**: Capture learnings, document outcomes, and identify action items for future improvements

Each phase has specific deliverables and decision gates to ensure alignment before moving forward.

### Roles and Responsibilities

#### Developers
- Implement features and fixes that meet acceptance criteria
- Write and maintain tests and documentation
- Participate in design and code reviews
- Assist in estimating and planning work
- Maintain high test coverage and observability

#### Product Managers
- Define what should be built to deliver customer and business value
- Own the product vision and strategy
- Prioritize the roadmap and backlog
- Validate solutions through user research and metrics
- Collaborate with stakeholders on trade-offs

#### Project Managers
- Coordinate delivery activities across the team
- Manage schedules, risks, and dependencies
- Facilitate meetings (kickoff, planning, retrospectives)
- Ensure consistent project documentation and status reporting
- Maintain transparency and alignment with stakeholders

### Communication Cadence

Regular communication is essential to project success:

- **Daily standups**: 15-minute focused sessions on progress, blockers, and dependencies
- **Weekly delivery syncs**: Review progress, demo completed work, and flag risks
- **Weekly PM/Product Manager syncs**: Strategic alignment on priorities and roadmap
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: High-level progress and milestone achievements
- **Sprint-end demos**: Showcase completed features at milestone reviews
- **Three-level escalation path**:
  - Level 1: Team-level triage in daily standup
  - Level 2: PM escalates to Product Lead and dependent teams
  - Level 3: Sponsor-level escalation for business-impacting issues

### Execution and Tracking

#### GitHub Projects Workflow
We use a structured board workflow: **Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done**

#### Pull Request Standards
- Keep PRs small (≤400 lines when possible) for easier review
- Include linked issues and acceptance criteria in PR descriptions
- Run automated CI checks (tests, linting, security scans) before requesting review
- Require at least one approval before merging

#### Branching Conventions
- Follow team-defined branching strategy documented in each project repository
- Use descriptive branch names that reference issue numbers

### Quality Assurance

Quality is built into every stage of development:

- **Unit tests**: Required for all new logic and business rules
- **Integration tests**: Applied where components interact with external systems or services
- **End-to-end smoke tests**: Validate critical user flows before release
- **Automated security scanning**: Integrated into CI pipelines to catch vulnerabilities early
- **Manual QA**: Performed for feature acceptance when automated testing isn't sufficient
- **Metrics tracking**: Monitor velocity, burndown, and success metrics through dashboards

### Release and Deployment

#### Release Types
- **Patch**: Critical hotfixes addressing production issues
- **Minor**: Incremental features and improvements
- **Major**: Significant functionality or breaking changes

#### Pre-release Requirements
- All acceptance criteria met and PRs merged
- Passing CI and security scans
- Release notes drafted
- Rollback plans documented
- Smoke tests prepared

#### Deployment Checklist
- Schedule deployment window (if needed)
- Create backup or snapshot (if applicable)
- Deploy to staging and run smoke tests
- Deploy to production (automated pipeline preferred)
- Run post-deploy verifications
- Announce release to stakeholders and support team

#### Rollback and Incident Management
- Use the Incident Playbook for production issues
- Trigger incident response and notify on-call team
- Rollback to last known-good release if necessary
- Conduct blameless retrospectives to capture learnings

### Contributing Updates to Documentation

Documentation should evolve with our practices:

- **Found something unclear?** Open an issue with the `documentation` label describing what needs improvement
- **Have a suggestion?** Submit a PR with proposed changes and tag relevant stakeholders for review
- **Process changed?** Update the relevant document and ensure consistency across related docs
- **Keep it current**: Review and update documentation quarterly or after major process changes
- **Store strategically**: Keep project-specific docs in project repositories; keep general process docs here in `/docs/`

### Integration with Copilot Spaces

To enable Copilot Spaces to use these docs as context for your project:
- Add relevant process documentation to your project's `.copilot/` directory
- Reference this documentation hub in your project README
- Keep project-specific templates and artifacts in your project repository
